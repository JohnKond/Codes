# Board Game: Sorry!

A Java Project for CS-HY252(Object-Oriented Programming).
For this Project I used MVC pattern(Model-View-Controller).

Sorry! is a board game that is based on the ancient Indian cross and circle
game Pachisi. Players move their two pieces around the board, attempting to
get all of their pieces "home" the other player.
